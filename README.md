## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Cosmic Todos follows a modern full-stack architecture leveraging Rust's ecosystem for both frontend and backend components, with Azure cloud services providing scalable infrastructure.

![Architecture Diagram](images/cosmis-rust-arch.png)

### Architecture Overview

The application is built on a **three-tier architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

- **Frontend Layer**: Leptos-based reactive UI compiled to WebAssembly, providing type-safe client-side interactions with excellent performance
- **API Layer**: Rust-based serverless functions hosted on Azure Functions, handling business logic and data validation
- **Data Layer**: Azure Cosmos DB providing globally distributed, multi-model database capabilities with automatic scaling

**Key Architectural Benefits:**
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end Rust ensures compile-time error detection and prevents runtime errors
- **Performance**: WebAssembly frontend delivers near-native performance in the browser
- **Scalability**: Serverless architecture automatically scales based on demand
- **Global Distribution**: Azure Cosmos DB enables low-latency access worldwide
- **Developer Experience**: Shared types and models between frontend and backend reduce duplication and increase maintainability

The architecture supports modern development practices including continuous deployment, containerization, and cloud-native patterns while maintaining the performance and safety guarantees that Rust provides.

### Cosmos DB
Cosmic Todos uses **Azure Cosmos DB** as its primary data store, providing a globally distributed, multi-model database service with the following features:
- **Multi-Model Support**: Supports document, key-value, graph, and column-family data models
- **Global Distribution**: Data is replicated across multiple Azure regions for low-latency access
- **Automatic Indexing**: All data is automatically indexed without requiring schema definitions
- **Rich Query Capabilities**: Supports SQL-like queries, stored procedures, and change feed processing
- **High Availability**: Offers 99.999% availability SLA with multi-region writes
- **Security**: Built-in encryption at rest and in transit, with fine-grained access control
- **Serverless Options**: Pay-per-request pricing model for cost efficiency
- **Change Feed**: Real-time data synchronization capabilities for reactive applications

Data is stored in a JSON-like format, allowing for flexible schema design and easy integration with the Rust application. The Cosmos DB SDK for Rust provides seamless interaction with the database, enabling efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

Example Cosmos DB Document Structure:

```json
{
  "id": "task123",
  "title": "Grocery Shopping",
  "description": "Buy groceries for the week",
  "status": "Not Started",
  "dueDate": "2023-10-15T12:00:00Z",
  "assignee": "family_member_id",
  "createdAt": "2023-10-01T10:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2023-10-01T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Azure Functions
Cosmic Todos uses **Azure Functions** to implement serverless APIs that handle business logic and data operations. This allows for a scalable, event-driven architecture that can respond to HTTP requests, database changes, and other triggers without managing server infrastructure.
